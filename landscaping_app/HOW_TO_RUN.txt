HOW TO RUN THE LANDSCAPING APP
==============================

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

2. Go to this folder:
   cd c:\Users\User\Desktop\landscaping_app\landscaping_app

3. Start the server (keep this window open):
   python app.py
   (Or double-click run.bat from that folder.)

4. When you see "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5050", open your browser.

5. In the browser address bar type exactly (no https, no trailing slash needed):
   http://localhost:5050

   Or try:
   http://127.0.0.1:5050

If you see "This site can't be reached":
- Make sure the server is still running (the terminal window is open and shows "Uvicorn running").
- Use http:// not https://
- Use port 5050 in the URL.
- Try temporarily turning off VPN if you use one.
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
